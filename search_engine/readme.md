# Decillion searching module:
All this module is efficient implemented in C++, with NGinx server and with the FastGCI protocol for server communication. The result is a efficient query server integrated with a modern interface that allows searching across 1 million + documents (see also crawling and indexing).

Check out an example of this module running with 1,000,068 documents: https://youtu.be/NUEC790Zv2I

### Compiling and running:
Running this modules requires the files generated by the indexing module to be in the folder <i>inverted_lists</i> and the folder <i>var/www/html/search_engine</i> to be placed on the folder defined on Nginx settings.

Use the command ```make``` to compile the search engine and the ```make start``` followed by ```make run``` commands to run the Nginx server.
